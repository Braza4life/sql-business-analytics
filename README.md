# SQL Business Analytics. From Raw Data to Decisions.

This repository showcases how SQL can be used as a primary analytics tool to transform raw data into business-critical insights.

The goal of this project is not to demonstrate SQL syntax, but to show:
- How data is modeled for analytics
- How business logic is expressed in SQL
- How executive-level KPIs are derived directly from source data

## Business Context

The project simulates a SaaS company with customers subscribing to monthly plans. Using only SQL, we answer key business questions around revenue growth, retention, and churn.

## Business Questions Answered
- How is Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) evolving over time?
- What is the customer churn rate per month?
- Which customer cohorts retain better?
- How much growth comes from new vs existing customers?
